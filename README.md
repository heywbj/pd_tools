# pd_tools
Direct interface to PhotonDesign's Fimmwave software.

## Overview

Uses Python magic methods to proxy all python variable access, function calls, indexing operations directly to the native commands in Fimmwave. Now you can code in Python exactly the same way you would issue commands at the Fimmwave command line. Supports tab-completion in the Python interpreter.
